A pure Java implementation of the http://sass-lang.com compiler

This project has previously a part of the Vaadin Framework

Roadmap
=======
Sass Compiler 1.0 
* Compatibility with sass-lang compiler 3.2.12

Sass Compiler 1.1
* Compatibility with sass-lang compiler 3.3.0

Import the project into Eclipse
=============================

To get the project working in Eclipse you need to install the M2E connector
for JavaCC, found at (update site):
http://objectledge.github.com/maven-extensions/connectors/updates/development

After that you can import the project into Eclipse as a standard Maven
project

Building the project
====================
Running

  mvn package

will compile the project and run all tests


Tests
=====
There is an extensive test suite consisting of source scss input and expected 
css output imported from the sass-lang project. Today the features required by
the tests in src/test/resources/sasslang are fully implemented while the
tests in src/test/resources/sasslangbroken are currently expected to fail.
When reaching 1.0 the sasslangbroken package should no longer exist.

Contributing
=============
Your contributions are more than welcome. Please read
https://vaadin.com/contribute for more information on practicalities.
Because we are using Gerrit we cannot accept pull requests in GitHub.
